From an environmental perspective, the decision may not directly impact the company's operations, but it may lead to increased consumption and waste as employees and executives may feel entitled to higher compensation. Socially, this decision may exacerbate income inequality and create a perception that the company prioritizes shareholder interests over those of its employees and the broader community. From a governance perspective, this decision may be seen as a conflict of interest, as executives and directors may benefit personally from the decision.
